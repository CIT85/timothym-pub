what is cascading
it is the order which it is read. it will read the css in the index.html before it read the external style.css directory.

the "p" is the selector. "color" is the property. "red" is the property value. Combine the color and red, you now have the declaration.

you have to use american english when coding like this. color and colour are the same but it will only allow color in the code.

starting the chapter 2 leason with a blank index and style.
starting with the elemnt selector. the BODY element can be used to set the font size. these change the body text to font size because of enhartice.
Pagraph element selects all paragraph element.

class selector starts with a "." and changes the class selector. in this case we are able to change it to gray. can use class more then once. they over rule the paragraph. classes are more common.

ID selector is more specific selector. ID must be used once in a html document. not good practice to use in CSS. 

you can do grouping in CSS. example would be h1, h2 {}. must be seperated by coma when using in grouping.

can use span to hight and uppercase certain text. better to use class. makes the code more usuable and keeps the code neat.

the last selector is the universal selector. selects everything on the page. it is use for a CSS reset.

now talking about cascading style sheets. works like a water fall.
whatever is on the bottom will be used on the top. the more specific electors you use the more it will overide general ones.

inherritance. border is not inherrit. best to use the body.
body element. Itâ€™s not inherited, no, form elements have their own styling. You need to specify styling for all form elements.

keeo code dry. dont repeat yourself.

sometimes things dont work out. but do not use this nuclear option. "!important" considered sloppy and unorganized. only use when you fully understand coding. considered lazy for beginners.

140 color names avaiable. can just use background insted of backgroun-color.

for font color all you have to type is "color" then you can choose your color.

multiple ways to choose a color. can use hexidecimal, can use rgb which is choosing colors by red blue greeen numbers. or you can just type it out.

you can also hover over the color square to bring up the color shading. which is a lot of fun. you can explore a lot more colors. when you come up on a color you like the code will auto fill the rgb for you.

you need this website to compare contrast colors. that way you are not just guessing what colors would work good. but it also gives you a rating based on the reviews on the internet. using this grading system will help out a lot and make it more professional.

week 4: I have more questions then answers. The whole idea about using the percentage for the width is still a little confusing to me. 
REM: font size of the root element.
CH The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font.
Dev tools are amazing. must use when I see something interesting on a website.

better to use percentage then to us VW. you have to be mindful of the coding you are doing to account for width and hight.

must remember to set the margin numbers for the box model. but seeing the actual numbers in the inspection mode on the dev tools is amazing and lets me know how my code is running. 

the browser will put in default numbers when I put in my rem numbers.
