        <h2>Academic Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I am taking this course because more and more jobs are asking for basic skills in coding. It also makes it makes me more marketable for job postings.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to learn more things that makes me stand out more in the job market. Plus, I like how my kids are amazed seeing words turn into a website.

        <p>
            Most of my goals are for selfish reasons or to just be petty.

            <li>
                Impress my kids and family.

            <li>
                Make a website to embarrass the loser in my fantasy league.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be able to take more  responsibilities at work to make me harder to replace.
