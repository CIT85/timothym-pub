  <h2>Why is Learning HTML is a good idea.</h2>
  <p>
    Interacting with any website is a neccessity in todays world. Almost everything is moving away from "pen to paper". We are now in the E-sign era. 
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML is used in every website. You have to be verse in it because you will be asked about changing some things in the companies website.

    The tools and resources that are esential for me to use everyday at my job.</p>
    <p>Usually a blog that explains why a HP printer is asking for a administrator password everytime you print.</p>
    <p>To uploading a code to a website to validate that it works.</p>
    <p>With that, I present to you my list of websites I use often.</p>

        Starting my career in Information Technology was not what I expected.
        Everyone is expecting you to have knowledge in every field IT has to
        offer but fail to see how vast this field actually is. I went in
        thinking with my degree I was ready to start my job. But as you begin
        your career you learn there are a lot of things they don't teach you
        that you should know.

      <h2>Better Chances at a Job.</h2>
      <p>
        To many times I have gone into a job interview where I expected to work
        as a Teir 1 Helpdesk and then being asking do I know how to code in
        website. As far as I know that is a task for someone that gets paid way
        more then I do. Not only that, but learning coding is esential when you
        are working in a network job.
